# Cultivating Success: Leveraging Machine Learning to Optimize Crop Selection
Assessing soil health by measuring critical metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and pH is vital for understanding soil conditions. However, this process can be both costly and time-intensive, often leading farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure based on their financial constraints.

Farmers face numerous decisions regarding which crops to plant each season, with their primary goal being to optimize crop yield. One significant factor influencing crop performance is soil condition, which can be gauged through measurements of essential elements like nitrogen and potassium. Each crop has specific soil requirements that support its optimal growth and yield.

A farmer has sought your expertise in machine learning to help determine the best crop for his field. The dataset provided, named soil_measures.csv, includes the following:

"N": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
"P": Phosphorus content ratio in the soil
"K": Potassium content ratio in the soil
"pH": Soil pH value
"crop": Categorical values representing different crops (target variable).
Each entry in this dataset reflects various soil measurements from a specific field, with the crop listed in the "crop" column being the ideal choice for that soil condition.

The goal of this project is to develop multi-class classification models to predict the crop type and identify the most critical feature contributing to predictive accuracy.
